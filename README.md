# Personal_Writeups
All of these are my journey to CTFs, Bug Bounty, or random Penetration Testing. I documented it in Github since I think it has more feature than the other platform, and of course so my Github activity will become more active also.

If you want to see my writeups, you can check in the <ins>**Branch**</ins>, I hope my writeups can explain my way of thinking and problem solving skill.
